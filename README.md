Size Limit is a performance budget tool for JavaScript. It checks every commit
on CI, calculates the real cost of your JS for end-users and throws an error
if the cost exceeds the limit.

* **ES modules** and **tree-shaking** support.
* Add Size Limit to **Travis CI**, **Circle CI**, **GitHub Actions**
  or another CI system to know if a pull request adds a massive dependency.
* **Modular** to fit different use cases: big JS applications
  that use their own bundler or small npm libraries with many files.
* Can calculate **the time** it would take a browser
  to download and **execute** your JS. Time is a much more accurate
  and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
* Calculations include **all dependencies and polyfills**
  used in your JS.

With **[GitHub action]** Size Limit will post bundle size changes as a comment
in pull request discussion.

With `--why`, Size Limit can tell you *why* your library is of this size
and show the real cost of all your internal dependencies.
We are using [Statoscope] for this analysis.

## Who Uses Size Limit

* [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)



## How It Works

1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)
   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).
   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.


## Usage

### JS Applications

Suitable for applications that have their own bundler and send the JS bundle
directly to a client (without publishing it to npm). Think of a user-facing app
or website, like an email client, a CRM, a landing page or a blog with
interactive elements, using React/Vue/Svelte lib or vanilla JS.

1. Install the preset:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/file
    ```

</details>


### JS Application and Time-based Limit

File size limit (in kB) is not the best way to describe your JS application
cost for developers. Developers will compare the size of the JS bundle
with the size of images. But browsers need much more time to parse 100 kB
of JS than 100 kB of an image since JS compilers are very complex.

This is why Size Limit support time-based limit. It runs headless Chrome
to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.

1. Install the preset:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-app
    ```

</details>


### Big Libraries

JS libraries > 10 kB in size.

This preset includes headless Chrome, and will measure your lib’s execution
time. You likely don’t need this overhead for a small 2 kB lib, but for larger
ones the execution time is a more accurate and understandable metric that
the size in bytes. Library like [React] is a good example for this preset.

1. Install preset:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-big-lib
    ```

</details>


### Small Libraries

JS libraries < 10 kB in size.

This preset will only measure the size, without the execution time, so it’s
suitable for small libraries. If your library is larger, you likely want
the Big Libraries preset above. [Nano ID] or [Storeon] are good examples
for this preset.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. First, install `size-limit`:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-small-lib
    ```

## Reports

Size Limit has a [GitHub action] that comments and rejects pull requests based
on Size Limit output.

1. Install and configure Size Limit as shown above.
2. Add the following action inside `.github/workflows/size-limit.yml`

```yaml
name: "size"
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  size:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CI_JOB_NUMBER: 1
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: andresz1/size-limit-action@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```


## Config

Size Limits supports three ways to define config.

1. `size-limit` section in `package.json`:

   ```json
     "size-limit": [
       {
         "path": "index.js",
         "import": "{ createStore }",
         "limit": "500 ms"
       }
     ]
   ```

2. or a separate `.size-limit.json` config file:

   ```js
   [
     {
       "path": "index.js",
       "import": "{ createStore }",
       "limit": "500 ms"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. or a more flexible `.size-limit.js` or `.size-limit.cjs` config file:

   ```js
   module.exports = [
     {
       path: "index.js",
       import: "{ createStore }",
       limit: "500 ms"
     }
   ]
   ```

Each section in the config can have these options:

* **path**: relative paths to files. The only mandatory option.
  It could be a path `"index.js"`, a [pattern] `"dist/app-*.js"`
  or an array `["index.js", "dist/app-*.js", "!dist/app-exclude.js"]`.

If you use Size Limit to track the size of CSS files, make sure to set
`webpack: false`. Otherwise, you will get wrong numbers, because webpack
inserts `style-loader` runtime (≈2 kB) into the bundle.

## JS API

```js
const sizeLimit = require('size-limit')
const filePlugin = require('@size-limit/file')
const webpackPlugin = require('@size-limit/webpack')

sizeLimit([filePlugin, webpackPlugin], [filePath]).then(result => {
  result //=> { size: 12480 }
})
```
